# Intro to Deep Learning for Computer Vision

Deep learning for computer vision is the core tech behind many camera kind of applications like self driving cars.

In the course, we will use tensorflow and the tensorflow implementation of keras(API). API (Application Programming Interface) are the links that allow different pieces of software interact with each other and kind of integrate with each other. Fpr example, any software like google chrome, notepad or file explorer when opened in windows has the same close button. This is because of the windows API that we don't have a different close button for each application.

This lesson is about convolutions. Convolutions are basic building blocks for deep learning models in Computer Vision.

Keras is the API here which is now built into tensorflow.

* We start by building models to get hands on experience on deep learning.
* Afterwards, we come back towards technical details neede to fine tune the model and addressing novel applications 
* We will learn deep learning using images, So we shall first see how images are stored in pixels.

>* grayscale image is a single 2d matrix for a number representing intensity of black in each pixel.
>* 3d images are stored in 3 2d matrices having number representing intensities of RGB in each pixel. Opencv uses BGR format for applications.

* Tensor is a word for something that is like a matrix but which can have many dimensions, so we will call matrices tensors from now on.So, grayscale image has 2D tensor representing Darkness.

## Convolutions

In deep learning, we apply convolutions to this type of tensor. A convolution is nothing but a small tensor that can be multiplied over little sections of main image.

Example -

<table>
<tr>
    <td>1.5</td>
    <td>1.5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>-1.5</td>
    <td>-1.5</td>
</tr>
</table>

This convolution is a **horizontal line detector** i.e. if we multiply on the part of the image that has horizontal line, it gives very large values. If there is no horizontal line, it gives value close to zero. For example if the image is (numbers represent intensity, so these are like four black pixels) 

<table>
<tr bgcolor = "black">
    <td>200</td>
    <td>200</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>200</td>
    <td>200</td>
</tr>
</table>

We multiply element by element i.e. 1.5 * 200 + 1.5 * 200 - 1.5 * 200 - 1.5 * 200 = 0, thus 0 signifies there is no horizontal line.

Now if we have this image - 
<table>
<tr>
    <td>200</td>
    <td>200</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
</tr>
</table>

Wehen we multiply by our convolution, we get 1.5 * 200 + 1.5 * 200 - 1.5 * 0 - 1.5 * 0 = 600, so a big number that means there is a horizontal line there.

We could have any kind of matrix 3 cross 3, 4 cross 7 as convolutions and the numbers inside them decide the pattern we want to seek out of the image. Combibng many convolutions together can generate really powerful methods.

# Intro

You don't directly choose the numbers to go into your convolutions for deep learning... instead the deep learning technique determines what convolutions will be useful from the data (as part of model-training). We'll come back to how the model does that soon.

But looking closely at convolutions and how they are applied to your image will improve your intuition for these models, how they work, and how to debug them when they don't work.

**Let's get started.**

### Exercise 1

In the video, you saw a convolution that detected horizontal lines. That convolution shows up again in the code cell below.

Run the cell to see a raw image as well as the output from applying this convolution to the image.

```python
horizontal_line_conv = [[1, 1], 
                        [-1, -1]]
# load_my_image and visualize_conv are utility functions provided for this exercise
original_image = load_my_image() 
visualize_conv(original_image, horizontal_line_conv)

```

**Replace the underscores with numbers to make a vertical line detector and uncomment both lines of code in the cell below. Then run **

```python
vertical_line_conv = [[1,-1],
                      [1,-1]]

# Check your answer
q_1.check()
visualize_conv(original_image, vertical_line_conv)

### Exercise 2
The convolutions you've seen are 2x2.  But you could have larger convolutions. They could be 3x3, 4x4, etc.  They don't even have to be square. Nothing prevents using a 4x7 convolution.

Compare the number of visual patterns that can be captured by small convolutions. Which of the following is true?

- There are more visual patterns that can be captured by large convolutions
- There are fewer visual patterns that can be captured by large convolutions
- The number of visual patterns that can be captured by large convolutions is the same as the number of visual patterns that can be captured by small convolutions?

**Answer** - While any one convolution measures only a single pattern, there are more possible convolutions that can be created with large sizes. So there are also more patterns that can be captured with large convolutions.

For example, it's possible to create a 3x3 convolution that filters for bright pixels with a dark one in the middle. There is no configuration of a 2x2 convolution that would capture this.

On the other hand, anything that can be captured by a 2x2 convolution could also be captured by a 3x3 convolution.

Does this mean powerful models require extremely large convolutions? Not necessarily. In the next lesson, you will see how deep learning models put together many convolutions to capture complex patterns... including patterns to complex to be captured by any single convolution.
