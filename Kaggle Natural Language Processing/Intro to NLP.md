# Intro to NLP

Text is some of the most valuable data for the ones who know how to use it. In this course about **NLP** , we will use the NLP library (spaCy) to take on some of the most important tasks in working with text.

We will learn - 

* Basic text processing and pattern matching.
* Building machine learning models with text.
* Represent text with word embeddings that numerically capture the meaning of words and documents.
