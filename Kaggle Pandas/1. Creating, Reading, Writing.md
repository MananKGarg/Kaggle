Here we learn to create our own data along with working with data that already exists.

## Getting started

```python
import pandas as pd
```

## Creating Data

There are two core objects in pandas: the **DataFrame** and the **Series**

### 1. DataFrame

-DataFrame is just a table. It contains array of entries of certain value. Each entry corresponds to a row(record) or a column.For example
```python
pd.DataFrame({'Yes': [50, 21], 'No': [131,2]})

```

output - 

.|Yes|	No
----| ----| ----|
0	|50	|131
1	|21|	2

DataFrame entries cannot only be integers. For ex

```python
pd.DataFrame({'Bob': ['I liked it.', 'It was awful.'], 'Sue': ['Pretty good.', 'Bland.']})
```
output - 

.|	Bob|	Sue
---| ---| ---|
0	|I liked it.	|Pretty good.
1	|It was awful.|	Bland.

* Thus, we are using pd.DataFrame() constructor to generate these data frame objects. Syntax is a dictionary whose keys are column names(Bob,Sue) and values are the list of entries.This is the standard way of creating dataframe.
* Dictionary list constructor assigns ascending count from 0(0,1,2,3) for the row labels. List of row labels is called as index. We can assign values to it by using an **index**parameter in our constructor.

```python
pd.DataFrame({'Bob': ['I liked it.', 'It was awful.'], 
              'Sue': ['Pretty good.', 'Bland.']},
             index=['Product A', 'Product B'])
```

output - 

.| Bob|	Sue
  ----| ----| ----|
Product A|	I liked it.|	Pretty good.
Product B	| It was awful.	|Bland.

### 2. Series

It is a sequence of data values, much like a list. We can create one with nothing but list.

```python
pd.Series([1,2,3,4,5])

output - 

0    1
1    2
2    3
3    4
4    5
```
