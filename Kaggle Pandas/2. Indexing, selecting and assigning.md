# Indexing, Selecting and Assigning

In most of the cases, we need to select specific values of a pandas DataFrame or Series to work on. So we need to learn to select the relevant data points quickly and effectively.

## 1. Naive Accessors

Naive python objects provide good ways of indexing data. Pandas carries all of these over which helps make it easy to start with.

Condider the DataFrame reviews from previous topic - 

```python
reviews
```

In python, we can access property of an object by accessing it as an attribute. For example **book** object might have a **title** property, which can be accessed by calling **book.title**. Columns in pandas DataFrame work in same way.

Thus to access the country column of reviews, we can do 

```python

reviews.country

output - 

0            Italy
1         Portugal
            ...   
129969      France
129970      France
Name: country, Length: 129971, dtype: object

```

If we have a python dictionary, we can access its value using the indexing([]) operator. We can do the same with columns in DataFrame.

```python

reviews['country']

output - 

0            Italy
1         Portugal
            ...   
129969      France
129970      France
Name: country, Length: 129971, dtype: object

```

These re the two ways to select a Series in pandas. There is however advantage in [](indexing) operator that names with reserved character can be handled. For example ```python reviews.country providence ``` will not work but ```python reviews['country providence']``` would work.

Also if we want to drill down to a single specific value, we need to use the indexing ([]) operator once more (just like a dictionary).

```python

reviews['country'][0]

output - 

'Italy'
```

## 2. Indexing in Pandas

* Indexing nd attributes work the same way in pandas as in rest of the python however pandas has its own accessor operators, **loc** and **iloc** for advanced operations.

### Index Based Selection

Pandas indexing works in one of two paradigms. First is **Index based selection** i.e. selecting data based on its numerical position in data.**iloc** follows this.

Example - To select the first row in data frame, we may use 

```python

reviews.iloc[0]

output - 

country                                                    Italy
description    Aromas include tropical fruit, broom, brimston...
                                     ...                        
variety                                              White Blend
winery                                                   Nicosia
Name: 0, Length: 13, dtype: object

```

Both **loc** and **iloc** are row first column second contrary to native python. To get a column with iloc 

```python
review.iloc[:,0]

output - 

0            Italy
1         Portugal
            ...   
129969      France
129970      France
Name: country, Length: 129971, dtype: object

```
on its own (:) operator means everything as in native python. It can be combined to get a range of values. For example to select country column for first 3 rows.

```python

0       Italy
1    Portugal
2          US
Name: country, dtype: object
```

or we can select second and third entries only

```python

reviews.iloc[1:3,0]

output - 

1    Portugal
2          US
Name: country, dtype: object

```

We can also pass a list

```python

reviews.iloc[[0,1,2],0]

output - 

0       Italy
1    Portugal
2          US
Name: country, dtype: object

```

Finally, we can also use negative numbers in selection

```python

reviews.iloc[-5:]

output - 

last 5 rows
```
