# Indexing, Selecting and Assigning

In most of the cases, we need to select specific values of a pandas DataFrame or Series to work on. So we need to learn to select the relevant data points quickly and effectively.

## 1. Naive Accessors

Naive python objects provide good ways of indexing data. Pandas carries all of these over which helps make it easy to start with.

Condider the DataFrame reviews from previous topic - 

```python
reviews
```

In python, we can access property of an object by accessing it as an attribute. For example **book** object might have a **title** property, which can be accessed by calling **book.title**. Columns in pandas DataFrame work in same way.

Thus to access the country column of reviews, we can do 

```python

reviews.country

output - 

0            Italy
1         Portugal
            ...   
129969      France
129970      France
Name: country, Length: 129971, dtype: object

```

If we have a python dictionary, we can access its value using the indexing([]) operator. We can do the same with columns in DataFrame.

```python

reviews['country']

output - 

0            Italy
1         Portugal
            ...   
129969      France
129970      France
Name: country, Length: 129971, dtype: object

```

These re the two ways to select a Series in pandas. There is however advantage in [](indexing) operator that names with reserved character can be handled. For example ```python reviews.country providence ``` will not work but ```python reviews['country providence']``` would work.

Also if we want to drill down to a single specific value, we need to use the indexing ([]) operator once more (just like a dictionary).

```python

reviews['country'][0]

output - 

'Italy'
```

## 2. Indexing in Pandas

* Indexing nd attributes work the same way in pandas as in rest of the python however pandas has its own accessor operators, **loc** and **iloc** for advanced operations.

### Index Based Selection

Pandas indexing works in one of two paradigms. First is **Index based selection** i.e. selecting data based on its numerical position in data.**iloc** follows this.

Example - To select the first row in data frame, we may use 

```python

reviews.iloc[0]

output - 

country                                                    Italy
description    Aromas include tropical fruit, broom, brimston...
                                     ...                        
variety                                              White Blend
winery                                                   Nicosia
Name: 0, Length: 13, dtype: object

```

Both **loc** and **iloc** are row first column second contrary to native python. To get a column with iloc 

```python
review.iloc[:,0]

output - 

0            Italy
1         Portugal
            ...   
129969      France
129970      France
Name: country, Length: 129971, dtype: object

```
on its own (:) operator means everything as in native python. It can be combined to get a range of values. For example to select country column for first 3 rows.

```python

0       Italy
1    Portugal
2          US
Name: country, dtype: object
```

or we can select second and third entries only

```python

reviews.iloc[1:3,0]

output - 

1    Portugal
2          US
Name: country, dtype: object

```

We can also pass a list

```python

reviews.iloc[[0,1,2],0]

output - 

0       Italy
1    Portugal
2          US
Name: country, dtype: object

```

Finally, we can also use negative numbers in selection

```python

reviews.iloc[-5:]

output - 

last 5 rows
```
### Label based selection

In this paradigm of selection, the data index value value matters and not its position. We use ```python loc ``` here.

For exampe to get first country in reviews, we do the following- 

```python

reviews.loc[0,'country']

output -

'Italy'
```

iloc is quite similar to loc but it ignores dataset indices but dataset indices can be meaningful many a times. iloc just treats the data set as a big matrix. One example of loc being meaningful is - 

```python

reviews.loc[:, ['taster_name','taster_twitter_handle','points']]
```

output - 

.|taster_name|	taster_twitter_handle|	points
----| ----| ----| ----|
0|	Kerin Oâ€™Keefe|	@kerinokeefe|	87
1|	Roger Voss|	@vossroger	|87
...|	...|	...	|...
129969|	Roger Voss|	@vossroger	|90
129970|	Roger Voss|	@vossroger	|90


### Choosing between loc and iloc

iloc excludes the last value while loc includes the last value in indexing. so df.loc[0:1000] will give 1001 elements and df.iloc[0:999] would give 1000 elements.

## 2. Manipulating the Index

The index we use for the dataset is noy immutable.  We can manipulate the index anyway we seem fit.

The ```python set_index() ``` method is used to do the job. for example, we can make the title column in our dataframe as our index -

```python

reviews.set_index('title')
 
# This would set index as the title of our dataset
```

This is useful particularly when we can come up with an index that for the dataset that is better than the current one.

## 3. Conditional Selection

Suppose we want to check better than average  the wines in Italy. So weneed to extract all the data related o italy. We can start by chacking whether each wine is italian or not.

```python

reviews.country == 'Italy'

output -

0          True
1         False
          ...  
129969    False
129970    False
Name: country, Length: 129971, dtype: bool
```
 This operation produced a series of true/false based on the country of each record.
 
 This result can be used inside of loc to produce relevant data.
 
 ```python
 
 reviews.loc[reviews.country == 'Italy']
 
 output -
  
 this produces the table with only records of italy.
 ```
 So basically we start to fiter out the information according to our needs.
 
 As we alos wnated to know which wines were better tan average, we would choose wines that got reviews>=90 using the ampersand(&) operator.
 
 ```python
 
 reviews.loc[(reviews.country == 'Italy') & (reviews.points>=90)]
 
 output -
 
 This gets us the table with with records of wines of Italy having hogher than 90 points
 ```
 Suppose we'll buy any wine that is made in Italy or is rated above average. to do that ,we use the pipe(|) operator.
 
 ```python
 
 reviews.loc[(reviews.country == 'Italy') | (reviews.points >= 90)]
 
 output - 
 
 This gets us table with either Italy or greater than 90 points wines
 ```
 Pandas come with a few built in functions like isin, isnull, notnull.
 
 * **isin** - isin lets us select the record whose value is in the list of values. For example, here's how we can select wines that are from Italy or France only.
 
 ```python
 
 reviews.loc[reviews.country.isin(['Italy','France'])]
 
 output - 
 
 This gives us the table of wines from Italy or France
 ```
 * **isnull** and **notnull** - These methods help us out in highlighting the values which are (or are not empty). For example, to filter out the wines that lack a price tag in dataset, here's what we can do - 
 
 ```python
 
 reviews.loc[reviews.price.notnull()]
 
 output - 
 
 This gives us the table after dropping the recors which don't have a price tag
 ```
 
 ## 4. Assigning Data
 
 On the other habd, assigning data to a dataframe is easy.
 
 ```python
 
reviews.['critic'] = 'everyone'
reviews.['critic']
 
0         everyone
1         everyone
            ...   
129969    everyone
129970    everyone
Name: critic, Length: 129971, dtype: object

```

or with an iterable of values

```python

reviews['index_backwards'] = range(len(reviews), 0, -1)
reviews['index_backwards']

output - 

0         129971
1         129970
           ...  
129969         2
129970         1
Name: index_backwards, Length: 129971, dtype: int64
