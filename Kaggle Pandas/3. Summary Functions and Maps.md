# Summary Functions and Maps

Data does not always come out of the memory the way we want it right off the bat.Sometimes, we have to reformat it for the task at hand. We'll us ethe wine reviews data here too.

## 1. Summary Functions

Pandas provide many 'summary functions'(not an official name) which restructures the data in some useful way. For example, consider the **describe()** method

```python

reviews.points.describe()

output - 

count    129971.000000
mean         88.447138
             ...      
75%          91.000000
max         100.000000
Name: points, Length: 8, dtype: float64

```

Thus, this method generated a high level summary of attributes of the given column. It is type aware i.e. its type changes on the basis of data type of input, For string data ,we would get

```python

reviews.taster_name.describe()

output - 

count         103727
unique            19
top       Roger Voss
freq           25514
Name: taster_name, dtype: object

```

If we want some particular simple summary statistic about a column in a data frame or a series, there will generally exist a useful pandas function to make it happen.

* For example to see the mean of the points alloted, we can use the mean function

```python

reviews.points.mean()

output - 

88.44713820775404
```
* To see a list of unique values, we can use the **unique()** function
```python

reviews.taster_name.unique()

output - 

array(['Kerin Oâ€™Keefe', 'Roger Voss', 'Paul Gregutt',
       'Alexander Peartree', 'Michael Schachner', 'Anna Lee C. Iijima',
       'Virginie Boone', 'Matt Kettmann', nan, 'Sean P. Sullivan',
       'Jim Gordon', 'Joe Czerwinski', 'Anne Krebiehl\xa0MW',
       'Lauren Buzzeo', 'Mike DeSimone', 'Jeff Jenssen',
       'Susan Kostrzewa', 'Carrie Dykes', 'Fiona Adams',
       'Christina Pickard'], dtype=object)
       
```

* To see a list of unique values and how often they occur in the dataset, we can use **value_counts()** method

```python

reviews.taster_name.value_counts()

output -

Roger Voss           25514
Michael Schachner    15134
                     ...  
Fiona Adams             27
Christina Pickard        6
Name: taster_name, Length: 19, dtype: int64

```
## 2. Maps

Map is just like map from maths where we map one set of values(output) to other set of values(input) using some function. To extract more meaningful observations from our data, we need to create new representations of data with us. Maps are what handle this work.

There are two mapping methods we often use

1. **map()**

* it is a slightly simpler method. For example, let us suppose we want the mean to shift to 0.

```python

review_points_mean = reviews.points.mean()
reviews.points.map(lambda p: p - review_points_mean)

output - 

0        -1.447138
1        -1.447138
            ...   
129969    1.552862
129970    1.552862
Name: points, Length: 129971, dtype: float64

```

The function we pass to map() should expect a single value from the series( a point value in above example) and return a transformed version of that value. map() returns a new series where all the values have been transformed by our function

2. **apply()**

* apply() is the equivalent method if we want to transform a whole DataFrame by calling a custom method on each row. For example

```python

def remean_points(row):
    row.points = row.points - review_points_mean
    return row
    
reviews.apply(remean_points, axis = 'columns')

output - 

This gives us the transformed data frame in which there are values about 0 in price column.

```

If we had called reviews.apply() with axis = "index", then instead of passing a function to transform each row, we would need to give a fuction to transform each column

**Note** - map() and apply() return new, transformed DataFrame or Series and don't modify the original data they are called upon. Orogina data is still saved and we don't have to worry that we may lose original data.

Pandas also provide many builtin mapping operations. for example, a faster way of remeaning our points column is - 

```python

review_points_mean = review.points.mean()
review.points - review.points.mean

output - 

0        -1.447138
1        -1.447138
            ...   
129969    1.552862
129970    1.552862
Name: points, Length: 129971, dtype: float64
```
In the code above, we are performing operation between a series and a single value. So this is kind of operator overloading and pandas knows that we mean to subtract a single mean value from all the data entries in the column.

Pandas would also know what to do if we perform these operations between Series of equal lengths. For example, an easy way of combining country and region information in the dataset would be to do -

```python
reviews.country + ' ' + reviews.region_1

output - 

0            Italy - Etna
1                     NaN
               ...       
129969    France - Alsace
129970    France - Alsace
Length: 129971, dtype: object

```
These are fast builtins but map and apply are useful for complex transformations.
