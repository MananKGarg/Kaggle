# Summary Functions and Maps

Data does not always come out of the memory the way we want it right off the bat.Sometimes, we have to reformat it for the task at hand. We'll us ethe wine reviews data here too.

## 1. Summary Functions

Pandas provide many 'summary functions'(not an official name) which restructures the data in some useful way. For example, consider the describe() method

```python

reviews.points.describe()

output - 

count    129971.000000
mean         88.447138
             ...      
75%          91.000000
max         100.000000
Name: points, Length: 8, dtype: float64
