# Data Types and Missing Values

We'll now investigate datatypes in a dataframe or series

## 1. Dtypes

datatype of a column in a dataframe or series is called dtype. We can use dtype to obtain the type of data in specific column. For example-

```python

reviews.price.dtype

output - 

dtype('float64')
```

* dtypes property returns datatype of evry column in the dataframe

```python

reviews.dtypes

output - 

country        object
description    object
                ...  
variety        object
winery         object
Length: 13, dtype: object
```

* One thing to note is that columns which are entirely strings are alloted object datatype.
* We can convert one dtype into another wherever it makes sense by using astype(). For ex, we can convert points column from int64 to float64.

```python

reviews.points.astype('float64')

output - 

0         87.0
1         87.0
          ... 
129969    90.0
129970    90.0
Name: points, Length: 129971, dtype: float64

```
* A dataframe or Series index also has a datatype

```python

reviews.index.dtype

output - 

dtype('int64')
```

## 2. Missing Data

Entries missing are given **NaN** (Not a Number), these are of float64 types

* To select NaN entries, we can use pd.isnull() or pd.notnull(). For example - 

```python

reviews[pd.isnull(reviews.country)]
```

* We can use fillna() to replace missing values. For example, we can replace 'NaN' with an 'Unknown'

```python

reviews.region_2.fillna('Unknown')

output - 

0         Unknown
1         Unknown
           ...   
129969    Unknown
129970    Unknown
Name: region_2, Length: 129971, dtype: object
```
* We could also fill each missing value by the next non null value in the database. This is known as backfill strategy.
* We may also replace a non null value by replace() method

```python

reviews.taster_twitter_handle.replace('@kerinokeefe','@kerino')

output - 

0            @kerino
1         @vossroger
             ...    
129969    @vossroger
129970    @vossroger
Name: taster_twitter_handle, Length: 129971, dtype: object
```
